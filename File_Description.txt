The package consists of three main scripts:

1)	Climatology
	This script calculates the "first guess" for the estimation of the rainy season.
	It is referred as step 2 in Seregina et al. 2018. 
	There are two versions of the script:
		a) climatology_stations.ncl is written for station data as input. 
		b) climatology_sat.ncl is written for gridded datasets
	
	Both versions require a netcdf-file as input.
	
	The scripts perform following operations:
	-- read data
	-- estimate the month of lowest rainfall that marks the starting point of the hydrological year
